Many thanks to him for his work on this.

## Description: 

This script creates a spell bar that allows you to cast spells from your spell gems. It also allows you to memorize spells from the spell picker.

	* Right Clicking on a spell gem will bring up a context menu to memorize, inspect, or clear the spell.
	* Right Clicking on an Empty spell gem will bring up the spell picker to memorize a spell.
	* Left Clicking on a spell gem will cast the spell.
	* Spells that are on cooldown will have a cooldown overlay.
	* Spells that are not ready to cast will have a faded gem overlay.
