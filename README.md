Many thanks to him for his work on this.

## Description: 

This script creates a spell bar that allows you to cast spells from your spell gems. It also allows you to memorize spells from the spell picker.

* Right Clicking on a spell gem will bring up a context menu to memorize, inspect, or clear the spell.
* Right Clicking on an Empty spell gem will bring up the spell picker to memorize a spell.
* Left Clicking on a spell gem will cast the spell.
* Spells that are on cooldown will have a cooldown overlay.
* Spells that are not ready to cast will have a faded gem overlay.
* Added timers for when we detect you memorized a new spell
* Added checks to see if you cast a spell without clicking the gem
* Window is resizable into rows and columns as you see fit. 
* Right Clicking the Title bar will bring up options to change theme, and Auto-resize the window.
